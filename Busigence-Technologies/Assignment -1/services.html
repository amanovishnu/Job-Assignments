            <p>Canalys Channels Forum 2018 Microsoft is still going to ditch or spin off the Surface line in 2019, insists the analyst who first made the prediction a year ago, despite the line-up's annual refresh this month.</p>

                        <p>The Surface was launched during the tenure of former CEO Steve Ballmer in 2012, when he eyed with some envy the success Apple was enjoying with its Macs and iPhones.</p>
                        <p>The big bald one also presided over Microsoft's buy of Nokia to compete with Apple's dominant handset, but we all know how that went.</p>
                        <p>Apple now has low single-digit share of the total PC market, and isn't looking like the big challenger to the Windows franchise it once was, Brazier said.</p>
                        <p>"It would be much more sensible for Microsoft to stop spending money on Surface and focus on its cloud and application business where it's doing really well," he claimed. Microsoft could then pass any design ideas to its frenemies that also make PCs, Brazier added.</p>
                        <p>Senior figures at Lenovo and Dell last year told us they believed Microsoft would also get out of the Surface hardware game – perhaps that was wishful thinking on their part. It certainly looks so now.</p>

                        <p>Powered by Function X, an ecosystem built entirely on and for blockchain, the new device is said to run on a new transmission protocol and is expected to significantly expand the use of blockchain technology beyond financial transfers.</p>
                        <p>In its press release, Pundi X claimed that unlike some of the other blockchain-powered phones that have been announced, the XPhone will be able to operate independently of centralized carriers. “Users can route phone calls and messages via blockchain nodes without the need for phone numbers”, said the company.</p>

                        <p>Built on a new 12nm LP process, the Ryzen 7 2700 from AMD has been clocked at a base clock speed of 3.2GHz, with a max boost clock of 4.1GHz. Before we get any further into the review, let’s take a quick look at the specifications of the Ryzen 7 2700:</p>
                        <p>An iterative upgrade to the AMD Precision Boost technology that debuted with the first-gen Ryzen processors, the Precision Boost 2 technology allows the processor to monitor its own energy consumption and temperature in order to help users safely overclock the processor. The technology allows the processor to assess when it’s running smoothly at a particular frequency and then raise the clock speed in precise 25MHz steps to ensure stability.</p>

            <p>Budget smartphones don’t get enough attention for the camera performance, and rightfully so. As long as it works and is consistent, it is a good camera, in my opinion. So, I judged the Nokia 3.1 Plus accordingly, and I found the Nokia 3.1 Plus’ camera to be pretty good, at least for the price.</p>

                        <p>The Nokia 3.1 Plus wields dual cameras at the back – a 13MP primary sensor (f/2.0 aperture) and secondary 5MP depth sensor for portrait shots. On the front, there’s an 8MP selfie shooter. The specs look decent on paper, right? Well, here’s how it performs in the real world –</p>
                        <p>Coming to low light performance, the Nokia 3.1 Plus really had a hard time showing some promising results. The images turned out to be bright, but they were way too soft for my liking. Portrait photos, on the other hand, also turned out to be decent. There were some instances when I was pleasantly surprised by the output, but I wasn’t able to produce Instagram-worthy portraits.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The iPhone XS is Apple’s flagship offering for this year, and it comes with improvements and changes big and small. While the new iPhone XS has an upgraded A12 Bionic processor which results in blazing fast performance, it certainly looks like the iPhone XS got a downgrade in terms of battery — at least on paper. So, if you’re wondering what the battery life of the new iPhone XS is like, well I’ve been using it as my daily driver for over 2 weeks now, and I’ll take you through everything you need to know about the iPhone XS battery.</p>

                        <p>So, the iPhone XS supports fast charging, which definitely sounds like great news doesn’t it? Well, it is, but Apple decided to not bundle a fast charger with the phone, opting to give us a measly 5W charger instead. That’s really insane for any flagship, and especially one that is priced at a whopping Rs. 1 Lakh.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, I tested the charging speeds of the iPhone XS with the bundled charger, and guess what, it’s excruciatingly slow. The iPhone XS takes a full 3 hours to charge from anywhere near 15% to 100%. Don’t forget that charging time is for a 2,658 mAh battery. You could fast charge it if you like (and then it goes from 10 to 50% in 30 minutes), with a 30W charger with Power Delivery, and a USB Type-C to Lightning cable to go along with it, and Apple even sells that for a combined price of $70, but honestly, that’s just disgraceful. I could rant about this all day long, but let’s move on.</p>

                <p>If you are blaming inadequate 4G availability for poor video streaming experience on your smartphone, you are most certainly barking up the wrong tree, suggests a new study of all of India’s 22 telecom circles on Thursday. India’s mobile operators have been successful in making 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) widely available across the country, but, unfortunately, a great mobile video experience does not correlate with the high 4G availability, said the study by London-based wireless coverage mapping company OpenSignal.</p>

            <p>The Honor family is growing and expanding and it gives me an immense pleasure to announce the inauguration of our new office in Bangalore. Honor is one of the fastest growing smartphone brand in India today and the latest report by IDC is a testimony to our commitment in the Indian smartphone market. With the inauguration of our new office we wish to strengthen our operations and produce more made in India products to serve our customers better and help them grow</p>

                       <p>Huawei’s Honor subsidiary is rapidly strengthening its foothold in the Indian smartphone market and aims to further consolidate its presence in the country. With the same goal in mind, Honor has today inaugurated the company’s India Device office at the Kaverappa Layout in Bengaluru.</p>
                       <p>The new office, which is spread over 6000 sq.ft, will serve as a dedicated seat of operations for Honor devices in India, following the establishment of Honor’s first overseas software development center in the state capital.</p>
                       <p>The growth can be attributed to the launch of aggressively-priced smartphones in different price brackets which offer respectable specs and undercut the competition. The company’s pricing has paid dividends too, with the Honor Play selling out in just 20 seconds in its first sale on Amazon, while the affordable Honor 7A went out of stock in just 2 minutes in its first sale on Flipkart. Inauguration of the India Device office in Bengaluru indicates that Honor aims to prolong its hot streak of success in India and challenge the domination of names like Xiaomi.</p>
